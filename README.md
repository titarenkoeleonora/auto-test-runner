# Welcome to Auto test runner üëã

> An automated test runner that executes tests in the browser and reports on their results as soon as each test has completed.

## What's done

- [x] The app should run all tests simultaneously
- [x] Initially, each test should be in the ‚ÄúNot Started‚Äù state, waiting for the user to press a button to run them. Once tests start running, the UI should update in real-time without needing further user interaction
- [x] Tests should have statuses: Not Started, Running, Passed, or Failed
- [x] Information about the number of ongoing, successful, and failed tests should be shown. An indication (such as "DONE!") when all tests are finished 

As a bonus :

- [x] App testing with Jest and react-testing-library allows testing the app from a user side and accessibility
- [x] Style-components to separate business logic from rendering logic
- [x] App deployed to Vercel
- [x] ESlint and prettier for automatic code formatting and matching it to best practices and code style
- [x] Responsive layout
- [x] Some comments during the code with potential improvements (can find by word "IMPROVEMENT")
